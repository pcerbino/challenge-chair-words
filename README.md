# Challenge Words Circle

#### Challenge task

>  *Given a list of words, determine whether the words can be chained to form a circle. 
A word X can be placed in front of another word Y in a circle if the last character of X is same as the first character of Y.
For example, the words ['chair', 'height', 'racket', touch', 'tunic'] can form the following circle:
chair --> racket --> touch --> height --> tunic --> chair
The output it has to be a txt file with one word per line, ex:
chair racket touch height tunic
Is very important the logic and the performance of the algorithm.*
